  <h1 class="h4 mb-3">Privacy notices</h1>

  <div class="alert alert-info">
    These notices explain how we use personal data across Registers, Exams, and Feedback.
  </div>

  <h2 class="h5">Registers (attendance)</h2>
  <p>
    We collect your name and attendance to confirm course participation and for safety/quality records.
    We do not use register details to contact you directly. Registers may be shared with your employer,
    but not with other organisations. Registers may be used to help create an assessment matrix.
    If we must share for external audit, we will anonymise the data wherever possible. Your name will be held on record
    for six (6) years and then deleted for audit and certification verification (unless a longer period is required by law
    or contract).
  </p>

  <h2 class="h5">Exams</h2>
  <p>
    Exam data is used to evidence knowledge and verify eligibility to sit the exam. Personal information
    is used only for identity and eligibility checks. It will not be used to contact you. Your overall
    result (Pass/Fail/Viva outcome) may be shared with your employer; individual answers are not shared.
    If external sharing is required (e.g., audit), we will anonymise responses wherever possible. Your name will be 
    held on record for six (6) years and then deleted for audit and certification verification (unless a longer period is
    required by law or contract).
  </p>

  <h2 class="h5">Feedback</h2>
  <p>
    Feedback is used for internal quality monitoring. We will only contact you if you explicitly request
    contact within the feedback form. Anonymised feedback may be shared with your employer. If you put your contact details 
    onto the feedback form, these will be deleted after two (2) years. Anonymised feedback records may be kept for up to six (6) years.
  </p>

  <h2 class="h5">Accident Reports (Training examples)</h2>
  <p>
    These accident reports are fictional training examples and should not contain
    real personal information. Any names or contact details entered will be
    automatically anonymised within twenty-four (24) hours to prevent accidental
    storage of personal data. These details are never used to contact anyone and
    are processed only for training purposes.
  </p>

  <h2 class="h5">Lawful basis</h2>
  <p>
    We process attendance and exam results under <em>legitimate interests</em> (training delivery and
    quality assurance) and, where relevant, <em>contract</em> (providing training services to your employer).
    Feedback processing is based on <em>legitimate interests</em>, and contact from feedback occurs only if
    you clearly consent to being contacted.
  </p>

  <h2 class="h5">Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain registers and exam results for up to <strong>6 years</strong> to meet training and audit
    requirements, unless a longer period is required by a contractual or regulatory obligation applicable to a specific course.
    Feedback records are typically retained for <strong>2 years</strong> for quality monitoring. We periodically review
    and securely delete data that is no longer required.
  </p>

  <h2 class="h5">Storage location</h2>
  <p>
    Data is stored on secure servers hosted by our cloud provider(s). Infrastructure location may change over time,
    but we require providers to meet appropriate security and compliance standards. Where data is transferred
    outside the UK/EEA, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.
  </p>

  <h2 class="h5">Future employer portal</h2>
  <p>
    If an employer portal is enabled, employers will have read-only access to the registers and results of
    their own staff only. Access will be role-based and restricted to authorised employer contacts.
  </p>

  <h2 class="h5">Your rights & contact</h2>
  <p>
    You can request access to your data, ask for corrections, or raise concerns about processing.
    You can also <strong>request deletion</strong> where we have no continuing lawful basis to retain the data.
    To exercise your rights, contact <a href="mailto:info@unicornsafety.co.uk">info@unicornsafety.co.uk</a>.
